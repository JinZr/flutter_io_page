# Performance Reports

- Place baseline measurements under `perf/before/`.
- Place optimized measurements under `perf/after/`.
- Store code size outputs from `flutter build web --analyze-size` inside the respective `size/` directories.
- Lighthouse JSON/HTML exports should be named `lighthouse-<metric>.json` (or `.html`).
